# Extracting Email Attachments from Outlook PST Files using Python

📧 Managing emails efficiently is crucial, especially when dealing with reports, invoices, or other important attachments. If you frequently receive emails with attachments in a Microsoft Outlook PST file and need an automated way to extract them, Python can help! 🚀

## Why Automate Attachment Extraction? 🤔

Handling email attachments manually can be time-consuming, especially if you receive frequent reports or need to process a large number of files. Automating this process with Python offers several benefits:

✅ **Saves time** – No need to download each attachment manually. 

✅ **Reduces errors** – Avoid missing important files. 

✅ **Organized storage** – Automatically save attachments to a predefined folder. 

✅ **Scalability** – Process multiple emails efficiently.

## How It Works 🛠️

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/Python_For_RF_Optimization_And_Planning_Engineer/blob/main/pst_attachmets_working/PIC_02.png?raw=true)

The Python script leverages the `win32com.client` library to interact with Microsoft Outlook and extract attachments from a specified PST file. Here’s an overview of the steps:

1️⃣ **Define Paths** – Specify the PST file location and the folder where attachments should be saved. 

2️⃣ **Initialize Outlook** – Connect to Microsoft Outlook using `win32com.client`. 

3️⃣ **Load the PST File** – Ensure the PST file is added to Outlook. 

4️⃣ **Access the Email Folder** – Navigate to the required folder inside the PST. 

5️⃣ **Extract Attachments** – Loop through emails and save the attachments to a designated folder.

## Prerequisites 🖥️

![](https://github.com/Umersaeed81/Python_For_RF_Optimization_And_Planning_Engineer/blob/main/pst_attachmets_working/PIC_03.png?raw=true)

To use this script, ensure you have: 

✔️ Microsoft Outlook installed on your system. 

✔️ The pywin32 library installed (`pip install pywin32`). 

✔️ A PST file containing the emails with attachments you need to extract.

## Real-World Applications 🌎

This automation can be beneficial for: 

📊 **Report Processing** – Automatically extract and store KPI reports, financial statements, or other scheduled reports. 

📂 **Document Archiving** – Maintain a structured archive of important email attachments. 

📌 **Data Analysis** – Extract and process data from email attachments for further analysis.

##  Import Required Libraries

This block imports the necessary libraries, including `os` for file operations and `win32com.client` for interacting with Outlook.
- **`pywin32`** is a Python package that provides access to Windows API functions, including COM objects.
- **`win32com.client`** is a **module** within `pywin32` that allows Python to interact with COM objects, like Microsoft Outlook, Excel, and Word.


```python
import os
import win32com.client
```

## Define Paths and Ensure Save Folder Exists

This block sets the paths for the PST file, target folder inside the PST, and the local save folder for attachments. It also ensures the save folder exists.


```python
# Define PST file path and folder name
pst_path = r"E:\PRS_Email\LTE_KPI_REPORTING.pst"
folder_name = "Repots"
save_folder = r"E:\PRS_Email\Attachments"  

# Ensure the save folder exists
os.makedirs(save_folder, exist_ok=True)
```

## Initialize Outlook 

This block initializes the Outlook application.

- This creates an instance of the Outlook application, allowing Python to interact with it.
- It launches Outlook in the background if it's not already open.


```python
# Initialize Outlook
outlook = win32com.client.Dispatch("Outlook.Application")
```

## Access MAPI Namespace

This block retrieves the MAPI namespace to interact with emails.

### Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI)

MAPI (Messaging Application Programming Interface) is a Microsoft-developed API that enables applications to interact with email messaging systems like Microsoft Outlook. It provides functionality for:

- Accessing emails, folders, and attachments
- Sending and receiving emails
- Managing contacts, calendars, and tasks
- Interacting with PST (Personal Storage Table) and Exchange mailboxes

There are two main types of MAPI:

1. **Simple MAPI** – A lightweight version for basic email functions (sending messages, opening the default email client).
2. **Extended MAPI** – A full-featured version allowing complete control over Outlook data, used in applications like Outlook itself.

In this code uses **Extended MAPI** because it interacts directly with Outlook’s internal storage and processes emails, folders, and attachments within a PST file.

### MAPI Namespace

- The **MAPI Namespace** is the **starting point** for accessing all Outlook data.
- It provides methods to manage PST files, navigate folders, and retrieve emails.
- Your code uses it to load a PST file and extract attachments from a specific folder.


```python
namespace = outlook.GetNamespace("MAPI")
```

## Add PST File to Outlook if Not Already Added

This block adds the PST file to Outlook if it is not already available in the account.


```python
# Add PST file if not already added
namespace.AddStore(pst_path)
```

## Retrieve the PST Root Folder

This block accesses the root folder of the specified PST file


```python
# Get the PST root folder
root_folder = namespace.Folders["LTE_KPI_REPORTING"]
```

## Access the Target Folder in PST

This block navigates to the specified folder inside the PST file where emails are stored.


```python
# Access the specific folder inside the PST
reports_folder = root_folder.Folders(folder_name)
```

## Extract and Save Email Attachments

This block iterates through emails in the specified folder, checks for attachments, and saves them to the defined local folder.


```python
# Loop through all emails in the folder
for mail in reports_folder.Items:
    if mail.Attachments.Count > 0:
        for attachment in mail.Attachments:
            attachment_path = os.path.join(save_folder, attachment.FileName)
            attachment.SaveAsFile(attachment_path)
            print(f"Saved: {attachment_path}")
print("Attachment download complete.")
```
