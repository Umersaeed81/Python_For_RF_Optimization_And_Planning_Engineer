# Automating Data Extraction from Excel Files in Python: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction
Managing data from multiple Excel files can be a tedious task, especially when dealing with large datasets that require extracting specific details. This article walks you through a Python script designed to automate the process of extracting key information from Excel files stored in a folder. By leveraging Python libraries like `os`, `pandas`, and `openpyxl`, this solution efficiently extracts and organizes the data into a consolidated output.

## Objectives of the Script
The goal of this script is to:

1. Extract specific key-value pairs from multiple Excel files stored in a folder.
2. Normalize the data into a consistent format.
3. Save the extracted information into a well-organized output file.

## Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code

## 1. Setting Up the Environment
The script starts by importing the necessary libraries:

- `os` for file operations.
- `pandas` for data manipulation and exporting.
- `openpyxl` to interact with Excel files.




```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from openpyxl import load_workbook
```

## Set Excel Files Path 

The folder containing the Excel files is specified with `folder_path`.

```python
# Folder containing the Excel files
folder_path = "D:/Advance_Data_Sets/WCMS"  
```

## 2. Defining Keys to Extract
A list of keys to extract from the Excel sheets is defined. These keys correspond to column headers or identifiers used in the dataset.

```python
# Define the keys to extract
keys_to_extract = [
    "Site ID", "Region", "City", "District", "Location Name", "Site Address", "Latitude",
    "Longitude", "Zain ID", "Site Name 2G", "Site Name 3G", "Site Name LTE", "Site Name 5G",
    "eNodeB ID", "5GNodeB ID", "Project ", "Objective", "Band", "Site Type", "Building Height", "Antenna Type"
]
```

## 3. Processing Files and Extracting Data

The script processes all `.xlsx` files in the specified folder to extract relevant data. For each file, the workbook is loaded using `openpyxl`, and the active sheet is accessed. The script then iterates through the rows of the sheet to match keys defined in `keys_to_extract`. If a cell value matches one of the keys, the corresponding value from a cell two columns away is retrieved and stored in a dictionary, which also includes the file name for reference. The dictionary is appended to a list (`all_data`) to gather data from all files. Finally, the collected data is converted into a `pandas` DataFrame for further manipulation.

```python
# Initialize a list to store the data from all files
all_data = []

# Loop through all Excel files in the folder
for file_name in os.listdir(folder_path):
    if file_name.endswith(".xlsx"):  # Process only Excel files
        file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file_name)
        
        # Load the workbook
        wb = load_workbook(file_path, data_only=True)
        sheet = wb.active
        
        # Initialize a dictionary to store the extracted data
        data = {"File Name": file_name}  # Include file name for reference
        
        # Loop through rows to find the desired keys and their values
        for row in sheet.iter_rows():
            for cell in row:
                if cell.value in keys_to_extract:  # Check if the cell value is one of the keys
                    data[cell.value] = cell.offset(column=2).value  # Get the value from the adjacent cell
        
        # Append the dictionary to the list
        all_data.append(data)

# Convert the list of dictionaries to a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(all_data)
```

## 4. Organizing the Columns

The script reorders the DataFrame to ensure the output follows the specified sequence. Additionally, it removes unnecessary spaces in column names.

```python
# Requierd Order
df1= df[['Site ID','Region','City','District','Location Name','Site Address',
        'Latitude','Longitude','Zain ID','Site Name 2G','Site Name 3G',
        'Site Name LTE','Site Name 5G','eNodeB ID','5GNodeB ID',
        'Project ','Objective','Band','Site Type',
        'Building Height','Antenna Type']]
df1.columns = df1.columns.str.strip().str.replace(r'\s+', ' ', regex=True)
```

## 5. Exporting the Final Output
The cleaned and structured DataFrame is exported as an Excel file.

```python
# Export Ouput
df1.to_excel("output.xlsx", index=False)
```
## Key Features of the Script
- **Dynamic Key Extraction**: Only the specified keys are extracted, ensuring focus on relevant data.
- **File Name Inclusion**: Each entry includes the source file name for traceability.
- **Normalization**: Leading/trailing spaces and irregular spacing in column names are removed for consistency.
- **Consolidation**: Data from multiple files is combined into a single, organized Excel file.

## Practical Applications
This script can be customized and applied in various scenarios, such as:

- Combining site information for network planning and optimization.
- Extracting project-related data for reporting.
- Streamlining data management tasks in industries reliant on structured Excel files.

# Conclusion
This Python script demonstrates a powerful approach to automating data extraction from Excel files, saving time and reducing the risk of manual errors. Whether you're working in telecom, finance, or any other data-driven field, this solution can be tailored to meet your needs. By organizing the output into a structured format, it ensures that you can efficiently analyze and utilize your data.

For more advanced use cases, consider adding error handling, logging, or visualizations to further enhance the scriptâ€™s functionality.
